<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Nice to meet you! I am Wenshuo ZHANG (张文硕), currently a Ph.D. student in HKUST VisLab, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. Huamin Qu.       

Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree in Automation, the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, supervised by Prof. Lei CHEN and Dr. Zhao CHEN at HKUST Guangzhou in 2024. I also obtain a dual Bachelor's degree in Accounting (ACCA Track), the Management School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, supervised by Prof. Hong ZHAO in 2024. During my UG study, I went to Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in the University of Hong Kong as a government-sponsored exchange student and worked with Prof. Xiaojuan Qi there.    

My research interest lies in Human-Centric AI.
