Nice to meet you! I am Wenshuo ZHANG (张文硕), currently a Ph.D. student in HKUST VisLab, at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. Huamin Qu and worked with Dr.Linping Yuan.       

Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree in Automation, the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, FYP supervised by Prof. Lei CHEN and Dr. Zhao CHEN at HKUST Guangzhou in 2024. I also obtain a dual Bachelor's degree in Accounting (ACCA Track), the Management School, Xi'an Jiaotong University, FPY supervised by Prof. Hong ZHAO in 2024. During my UG study, I went to Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in the University of Hong Kong as a government-sponsored exchange student.    

My research interest lies in Human-Centric AI.
